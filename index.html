        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Civil and Environmental
          Engineering (transportation engineering concentration) at the University of Virginia, 
          supervised by <a href="https://engineering.virginia.edu/faculty/b-brian-park"> Dr. B. Brian Park</a>. My work centers on using data-driven
          methods to understand and model transportation systems, including
          topics such as connected-vehicle data, traffic operations, and
          safety analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          I enjoy working at the intersection of transportation engineering and data science, and I am particularly interested in how large-scale
          trajectory and telematics datasets can inform better transportation planning and operations.
        </p>

            <h3>Smart Rideshare Matching</h3>
            <p>
              We investigated the feasibility of utilizing vehicular telematics data for ride-share matching. 
              Our focus was to optimize ride-share matching for users by utilizing personal preferences. 
              A case study was conducted using participants’ vehicular telematics data to analyze 
              their commuting patterns between their homes and the UVA campus.
